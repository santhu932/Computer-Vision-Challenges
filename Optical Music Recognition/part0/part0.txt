In part0, we have a noisy image of Pichu. After converting this image to the frequency domain, we can see that we have some kind of noise (is this the word "Hi"??). 
We can see that "Hi", in addition to some strong signal at some higher frequencies (the bright tilted areas). Therefore, we needed it to 
implement a low pass filter to remove the noises added.
A Gaussian filter was designed using the np.hamming function. Then, a multiplication was done in the frequency domain. 
The radius of the hamming function indicate the threshold of the low pass filter. 
We can see the reults in "lpf.png".
